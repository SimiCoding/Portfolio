I have coded several discord bots in the time using discord.js and got great feedback for them. <br> <br> I have developed a lot of websites and rebuild a lot of websites in the time. This Website is a rebuild of Britanny Chiangs Portfolio, in which I have not copied a single part of her code. <br> <br> In the time i developed and worked for Milrato Development I could gain a lot of popularity in the discord developer world. That time ended. I had a big pause with developing discord bots. Now im developing websites and apps.",

 timTubeText: "TimTube is a big youtuber I am working for as a moderator. I support his discord server as a head moderator and help him build up a bigger discord community. For that I had to learn some new technologies for discord bots. <br> <br> On his discord server I found alot of inspiration for my current projects the internet needs. With the help of his community I could develop this portfolio because they give me good feedback. <br> <br> I learned how to develop moderation bots for discord with discord.py and discord.js and I learned how to efficently sort problems into smaller problems and then solve them with a team.",

I have coded several discord bots in the time using discord.js and got great feedback for them. <br> <br> I have developed a lot of websites and rebuild a lot of websites in the time. This Website is a rebuild of Britanny Chiangs Portfolio, in which I have not copied a single part of her code. <br> <br> In the time i developed and worked for Milrato Development I could gain a lot of popularity in the discord developer world. That time ended. I had a big pause with developing discord bots. Now im developing websites and apps.",
